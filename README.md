# Homewebcam

## Idea
This repository is about the settings and configuration of a Raspberry Pi 2 running the [motion]() system

## Issues
* the default motion.conf created at the package install (in the Pi)is not working,
using the conf file from a fresh Debian install makes the job but still the process
is being run directly and not as a service
* Runnig motion directly from the command line disconnect the Pi from the wifi AP
